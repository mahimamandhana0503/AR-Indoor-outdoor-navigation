# AR-Indoor-outdoor-navigation

This project highlights the Augmented Reality approach for navigation inside the college campus and indoor navigation inside big buildings, where locating a person's office is a big deal. 
So we used Augmented reality SDK of Vuforia which provides a ground detection feature. The user clicks on the place where he/she wants to go and the arrows on the ground guide them to the destination.

**TECHNOLOGY USED**

* Unity3d
* Blender
* Vuforia sdk

We created two modules/scenes in our project:

* One for indoor navigation i.e navigation inside building
* Second for outdoor navigation i.e. navigation in a college campus etc.

USE-CASE:

As for now we did navigation for our college and our department.

When a person scans the QR code placed on the entrance of the college, a 3d-table top AR model is displayed to the user on their phone screen. The model is **miniature representation of the buildings**. On **tapping on one of the building** he/she can start **navigating** towards the building by following the arrows on their phone screens.

Similarly as the person enters the building and if he wants to navigate to HODs' cabin he/she can select HOD cabin and the arrows will direct the user towards the HODs' cabin.


**NOTE:** The application created will only work on high end phones such as s8+,note8, iphones(ios11 and above).
