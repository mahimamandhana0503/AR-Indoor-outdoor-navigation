# AR-Indoor-outdoor-navigation

This project highlights the Augmented Reality approach for navigation inside the college campus and indoor navigation inside big buildings, where locating a person's office is a big deal. 
So we used Augmented reality sdk of vuforia which provides a ground detection feature. The user clicks on the place where he/she wants to go and the arrows on the ground guide them to the destination.is navigated to the destination. 

**TECHNOLOGY USED**

* Unity3d
* Blender
* Vuforia sdk

We created two modules or scenes in our project:

* One for indoor navigation i.e navigation inside building
* Second for outdoor navigation i.e. navigation in a college campus etc.

USE-CASE:

As for now we did navigation for our college and our department.
So, whenever a person enters our college gate he/she can select which building he wants to go. A 3d-table top AR model is displayed to the user. The model is **miniature representation of the buildings**. On **tapping on one of the building** he/she can start **navigating** to the building.

Similarly as the person enters the building and if he wants to navigate to HODs' cabin he can select HOD cabin and green arrows will direct the user towards the HODs' cabin


**NOTE:** The application created will only work on high end phones such as s8+,note8, iphones(ios11 and above).
